You are going to write a program that calculates the highest score from a List of scores.

e.g. student_scores = [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]

Important you are not allowed to use the max or min functions. The output words must match the example. i.e

The highest score in the class is: x

Example Input
78 65 89 86 55 91 64 89
78 65 89 86 55 91 64 89
In this case, student_scores would be a list that looks like: [78, 65, 89, 86, 55, 91, 64, 89]


student_scores = input("Input a list of student scores ").split()
for n in range(0, len(student_scores)):
  student_scores[n] = int(student_scores[n])
print(student_scores)
# ğŸš¨ Don't change the code above ğŸ‘†

#First *fork* your copy. Then copy-paste your code below this line ğŸ‘‡
#Finally click "Run" to execute the tests
,,,

new_number=0
#Write your code below this row ğŸ‘‡
for score  in student_scores:
   if student_scores[n]>new_number:
      new_number=student_scores[n]
   else:
      continue
print(f'The highest score in the class is:{new_number}')
