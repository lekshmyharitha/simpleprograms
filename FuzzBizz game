You are going to write a program that automatically prints the solution to the FizzBuzz game.

Your program should print each number from 1 to 100 in turn.

When the number is divisible by 3 then instead of printing the number it should print "Fizz".

`When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".` 
`When the number is divisible by 5, then instead of printing the number it should print "Buzz".` 
  `And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"`
  `And if the number is divisible by both 3 and 5 e.g. 15 then instead of the number it should print "FizzBuzz"`
e.g. it might start off like this:

`1
2
Fizz
4
Buzz
Fizz
7
8
Fizz
Buzz
11
Fizz
13
14
FizzBuzz`

for numbers in range(1,101):
   if numbers%3==0:
      if  numbers%5==0:
        print('FizzBuzz')
      else:
        print('Fizz')
   elif numbers%5==0:
     print('Buzz')
   else:
     print(numbers)
